## Introduction

Flooat is a hardware description language and python framework for simulation. It is designed to be **friendly, simple, light and productive**. More easy to use and learn than Verilog and VHDL. Using Flooat, you can create integrated circuits component by using it's HDL or Python framework (or both) that work by the HLS (High Level Synthesis) concept.
